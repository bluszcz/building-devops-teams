## Engineering Mentality
[Solve problems with engineering solutions]{.fragment}

[Usually the alternative is "we need more people"]{.fragment}

[Or download another (newer) software]{.fragment}


## Download and play
[Download a piece of software]{.fragment}

[Fiddle and configure]{.fragment}

[Boom, instant value]{.fragment}

[Move on]{.fragment}

## Endless migration

[Problem - something does not quite fit or is not implemented]{.fragment}

[Solution is usually...]{.fragment}
[download and play something else]{.fragment}

[So we spend a significant chunk of our time migrating systems]{.fragment}

## Download, play, deep dive
[Alternative is to download, play and become a domain expert]{.fragment}

[What is core to you only]{.fragment}


## Download, play, contribute
[Even better alternative is to download, play, and contribute code]{.fragment}

[What is deep core for you only]{.fragment}


## Remember managed services


## Cassandra example

Problem - providing multiple Cassandra systems to several internal users

[Solution - Develop python-based Cassandra management system]{.fragment}

[Problem - Cassandra backup recovery takes 8h+]{.fragment}

[Solution - Develop new backup recovery system x4 times faster]{.fragment}

<!--
Priam was the solution we used before, check it out as it really cool.
The backup recovery system is much faster and leads to lower costs as well.

## Spinnaker example

Problem - Spinnaker does not support Travis

[Solution - Develop the support]{.fragment}
