<!-- Make those initiatives systematic -->


<!--
Initiative - Heroic efforts of individuals
Example: image transformation services like pixelating faces for media were developed by engineers close to the media
systems.
-->


## \#2 Structured support
Supporting the user teams effectively

Good old ticketing works better

We gathered data from teams and users both to support the decision ^_^
