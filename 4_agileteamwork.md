## Key metric - development / operations ratio

Make sure you have both Dev and Ops on the equation

Hint - Tag user stories by their nature and leverage estimation


## Key metric - Dogfooding

Early, unfiltered feedback is indeed essential

[DOGFOODING  = (ADOPTED OR FEEDBACK) x NUMBER OF SERVICES]{.fragment}
