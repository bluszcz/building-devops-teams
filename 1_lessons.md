# Building the teams

# 

## \#1 Be prepared to interview

## A lot
[Think of less than 10% conversion rate]{.fragment}

##  101
[Number of interviews done in 2016]{.fragment}

[Close to one every two working days]{.fragment}


## \#2 New teams need <br/>top-down tasks
[Forming a new team is hard work]{.fragment}

[Avoid the mistake of setting a blue sky project like 'cluster management']{.fragment}

[Set a specific short project instead, with clear value and impact]{.fragment}

[Team now mature? -> open up domain of work]{.fragment}



## \#3 Environment, architecture, implementation

[Avoid changing the architecture just because a new environment/implementation just appeared]{.fragment}

[Example - changing from client-side to server-side load balancing because a new environment supports it]{.fragment} 

[Example - Hystrix vs resilience4j - different impleementations, similar concept, similar architecture]{.fragment} 



## \#4 Look for a balance between develop-centric and ops-centric
[Excellence in operations alone is not enough]{.fragment}

[Nor is development expertise in isolation]{.fragment}

[Do you take into account security?]{.fragment}
